# Module 3: Programming paradigms

## Overview of Key Learnings

This module focuses on programming paradigms, specifically functional programming and object-oriented programming (OOP).

### Functional Programming

* Explains the concept of functional programming, emphasizing the separation of data from functions.
* Highlights how functional programming can be used to solve problems effectively.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Discusses the differences between OOP and functional programming.
* Introduces key OOP principles, including classes, constructors, and inheritance.

### JavaScript Scope and Features
