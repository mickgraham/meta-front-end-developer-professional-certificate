# Module 1: Anatomy of React

This module on React components provides a comprehensive overview of the foundational concepts necessary for building applications with React.js.

By the end of this module, learners will be equipped to explain React's component architecture, create and manage components, and effectively use props to enhance their applications.

### Introduction to React Components

* The module begins with an introduction to how React is utilized in real-world applications, featuring insights from a Meta software engineer.
* It covers the essential web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) needed to set up a React project in VS Code and work with JavaScript modules.

### Understanding Component Architecture

* The second lesson focuses on component-based architecture, explaining the types of components and their storage within applications.
* Key concepts include JSX syntax, the virtual DOM, and the process of transpiling JSX to HTML, which is crucial for building components.

### Component Usage and Styling

* The third lesson emphasizes passing data between components using props and rendering components multiple times with different properties.
* It also covers styling JSX elements and using embedded expressions, along with defining components through function expressions and arrow functions.
