# Module 2: Data and State

This module recap focuses on the key concepts of data and states in React.

### Dynamic Events and Event Handling

* You learned how to identify and handle common types of events in React Native.
* Event-handling code can be written using different syntax and components.

### Data Flow and State Management

* You explored how data flows in React, particularly from parent to child components.
* The concept of state was introduced, explaining its relation to component behavior and common state management approaches.

### Key Takeaways

* The module emphasized the importance of state and events in making React applications interactive.
* Upcoming modules will cover links, routing, and using assets in React, preparing you for your portfolio project.
