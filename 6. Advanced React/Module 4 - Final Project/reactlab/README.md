# Liam Turgeman – Portfolio  

A responsive portfolio website built with **React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router**.  
It showcases my design and development projects (like **EverGrow**), and highlights my skills in **UI/UX design**, **front-end development**, and **creative problem solving**.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- **Responsive design** — optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- **Custom parallax effects** — lightweight React hooks for smooth animations.  
- **Reusable components** — modular `Card`, `Hero`, `Navbar`, and `ContactForm`.  
- **Interactive navigation** — `react-router-dom` + `react-router-hash-link` for page/section jumps.  
- **Animations** — Lottie animations for micro-interactions (burger menu, scroll arrows).  
- **Accessible UI** — semantic HTML, focus states, ARIA labels.  
- **Contact form** — powered by **EmailJS** to send messages directly.
