# Module 4 - Designing Your UI

This course module recap highlights the key skills acquired throughout the lessons.

### Enhancing Design

* You learned to identify the use of images, colors, and shapes in design and explain their roles.
* You gained insights into how to enhance your overall design approach.

### UX/UI Design Principles

* You explored the importance of good form design and best practices to improve it.
* You learned about component-driven products and design systems, and how they engage audiences.

### Prototyping and Testing

* You developed skills to create interactive prototypes using high-fidelity designs in Figma.
* You learned how to animate and share these prototypes for testing and feedback with customers and colleagues.

## Additional resources

The following resources are additional reading materials that introduce you to high-and low-fidelity prototyping, user interface elements, creating a UI component design system, the architecture of a component and what mood boards are. These will add to the knowledge that you’ve gained in this lesson.
