# Applying design fundamentals in Figma

## Overview

This exercise will cover the steps from wireframes to high-fidelity mock-ups and apply design fundamentals using the brand style guide, which specifies every aspect of the look and feel of the brand. This includes typefaces, colors, and how pictures and images should be used. It also includes a UI kit, a set of files containing critical UI components like font sizes, icons and documentation. A Figma file of the wireframe used in this exercise and an image resource folder is provided in:

* Applying-design-fundmantals-in-Figma-Assets.zip
* Applying-design-fundmantals-in-Figma-Wireframe.zip

On completion, you will have the skills necessary to take the wireframes of your design solution for your project on the reserve-a-table section of the Little Lemon website to produce high-fidelity mock-ups.

## Scenario

The owners of the Little Lemon Restaurant have approved the wireframes for their website and want you to turn these wireframes into a high-fidelity design or a design that closely resembles the final product using their brand style guide.

## Instructions

* Next up is the Hero section.
* Finally, work with the Highlights section.
