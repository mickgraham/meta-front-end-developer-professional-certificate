# Module 3: Project Functionality

This course content focuses on the completion of the third module of a project functionality for a front-end application.

### Project Functionality Overview

* You built a table booking system, revisiting concepts like React components, state management, and semantic code.
* You implemented unit tests and tracked updates using Git.

### Interacting with the API

* You learned to interact with a table booking API using the fetch function and the useEffect hook for side effects.
* You updated the app's internal state with data from API calls and continued writing unit tests.

### Improving User Experience (UX)

* You emphasized form validation to enhance user experience and accessibility.
* You conducted usability evaluations and heuristic assessments to identify and address UI issues, ensuring the app is accessible to all users.

## Additional resources

Here is a list of resources in the form of additional reading materials that will help you gain more insight into project functionality related to the table booking system of your app project.

* The article on [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring) syntax allows you to get values out of the array that are returned when the useState hook is invoked. This resource describes how the destructuring assignment works in more detail.
* The [Read props inside the child component](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) link on the Beta version of React docs discusses how to use destructuring assignment to get values out of the props object.
* The [useState reference](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) on the official React docs website helps you to understand how to work with this hook and some of the caveats involved.
* The [useEffect reference](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) on the official React docs website helps you to understand the syntax of this hook and goes into some depth to explain how to use and troubleshoot the useEffect hook.
* The [rules of hooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) reading on the reactjs.org website gives you an overview of how to work with the hooks as recommended by the React Core team at Meta.
* The [useReducer hook](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)
 reference on the reactjs.org website discusses the basics of useReducer, along with specifying initial state and lazy initialization.
* The [using the useRef hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) reference on the reactjs.org's docs website is a great example of various options that are available when working with this hook.
* The [reusing logic with custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) on reactjs.org discusses the dynamics of custom hooks and goes to some length in giving a few practical examples to complement the theory behind them.
