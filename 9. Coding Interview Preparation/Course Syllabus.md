# Course syllabus

This course focuses on preparing you for the unique aspects of a coding job interview, emphasizing problem-solving approaches and foundational computer science knowledge.

## Prerequisites

To take this course, you should understand the basics of computer programming and development. Additionally, it always helps to have a can-do attitude!

Ideally, you should have completed all the courses in this professional certificate.

## Course content

This course contains 4 modules and will help prepare you for the unique aspects of a coding job interview, with approaches to problem-solving and computer science foundations.

### Module 1: Introduction to the coding interview

In this introductory module, you'll learn what a coding interview is, what it may consist of, and the types of coding interviews you might encounter. You'll discover how to prepare for a coding interview, focusing on communication and working with pseudocode. You will also get an introduction to computer science, including the fundamental concepts of Binary, Big O notation, and time and space complexity.

In this module you will:

* Understand what a coding interview entails and the various types you may encounter.
* Have a strategy and a collection of tips to prepare you for successful interviews.
* Recognize the role pseudocode plays in coding interviews.
* Learn preparation strategies, including effective communication and using pseudocode.

### Module 2: Introduction to data structures

The second module of this course covers data structures. You'll learn about the implementation and capabilities of data structures across various programming languages and the similar patterns of the overarching architecture. You will learn about basic data structures, such as strings, integers, arrays and objects, before moving on to collection data structures, including lists, stacks and trees, and advanced data structures, such as hash tables, heaps and graphs.

In this module you will:

* Explore basic data structures like strings, arrays, and objects, along with their implementation across programming languages.
* Examine advanced data structures such as hash tables, heaps, and graphs, and their benefits and limitations.
* Recognize data structures that are commonly found in coding interviews.

### Module 3: Introduction to algorithms

In this module, you'll learn about algorithms. You'll cover common approaches to sorting and searching with algorithms. You'll also explore the time and space complexity aspects of sorting and searching. You will then learn about working with algorithms, demonstrating how to visualize and problem-solve with algorithmic approaches, such as divide and conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.

In this module you will:

* Discover different types of algorithms, focusing on sorting (selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort) and searching algorithms.
* Gain insights into time and space complexity, and learn about advanced concepts like recursion and dynamic programming.
* Combine new and previously learned coding patterns to solve problems.


### Module 4: Final project

In this module, you will be assessed on the key concepts and topics covered in the course by taking the course quiz. You will complete this graded assessment with ten questions to test your knowledge and understanding of all the concepts and skills you have learned throughout the course.
