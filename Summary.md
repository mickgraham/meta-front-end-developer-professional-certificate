* How to code and build interactive web pages using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. 
* In-demand design skills to create professional page layouts using industry-standard tools such as Bootstrap, React, and Figma. 
* GitHub repositories for version control, content management system (CMS) and how to edit images using Figma.

### Applied Learning Project

Throughout the program, you'll engage in hands-on activities that offer opportunities to practice and implement what you are learning. You'll complete hands-on projects that you can showcase during job interviews and on relevant social networks.

At the end of each course, you'll complete a project to test your new skills and ensure you understand the criteria before moving on to the next course. There are 9 projects in which you'll use a lab environment or a web application to perform tasks such as:  

* Edit your Bio page—using your skills in HTML5, CSS and UI frameworks
* Manage a project in GitHub—using version control in Git, Git repositories and the Linux Terminal 
* Build a static version of an application—you'll apply your understanding of React, frameworks, routing, hooks, bundlers and data fetching. 
* At the end of the program, there will be a Capstone project where you will bring your new skillset together to create the front-end web application.
